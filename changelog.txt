CHANGELOG
==========================================================================================
v1.01
==========================================================================================
- Not released

==========================================================================================
v1.02 - 6 June 2014
==========================================================================================
- Public Release

==========================================================================================
v1.03 - 3 September 2014
==========================================================================================
- Fixed a bug where election events failed to remove party modifier from last election
- Fixed folder name for /common (was typo’ed /commons, a poor oversight on my part)
- Added a new form of government, the Parliamentary Monarchy, to be used instead of the Constitutional Monarchy when government form is changed through Glorious Revolution event.
- Changed requirements for most of the parliamentary mod events to account for the new government form mentioned above, though having the constitutional monarchy can still trigger it (this may change, though).

==========================================================================================
v1.04 - 10 October 2014 (Major changes so please read all of this before you install this)
==========================================================================================
1. General
------------------------------
-Overhauled the election event system. No longer can you singlehandedly select a party to lead the HM government. Instead, now you can only attempt to influence the election outcome towards a party at a price starting at 50 ducats in 1688, doubling every period until it reaches 1,000 ducats by 1834, the beginning of last election period. It becomes more expensive over time, to represent waning influence of the Crown on parliamentary elections over time. You can just select “No preference” option which will not cost any ducats. Election now takes up to 90 days before results are announced. The election will not always go your way, so keep that in mind.
-As part of the election system overhaul, prime minister selection was also introduced where you can select a prime minister from 3 candidates (most of them named after prominent statesman in British history of the period such as Sir Robert Walpole and Lord Liverpool) affiliated with the party that won the election after 1721, each for a particular category (ADM, DIP, or MIL). Each gives tech cost reduction for the category you chose but increases cost for other tech. Almost effectively a mirror of the national focus, except it modifies the tech cost, not monarch point. You’d best think about which prime minister you want, as you cannot go back before next election. However, like the ministry itself, prime minister can be dismissed via loss of confidence vote event or an event concerning conflict between monarch and ministers.
-Parliamentary vote of confidence and constitutional crisis events have accordingly been updated to account for new prime minister mechanism
-Parliamentary Monarchy, the new government type unique to England / Great Britain introduced in last version, has its effects adjusted/changed. Heavy ship power bonus was dropped as it did not made sense, having nothing to do directly with government, despite British reputation for sea power. Legitimacy was also cut to 1.25 from 2, keeping slightly higher than ordinary Constitutional Monarchy. Manpower recovery speed was also cut to 0.1 from 0.2. All other bonus such as tolerance and prestige decay remained intact. Years of nationalism modifier was added, same value as Constitutional Monarchy. Those may be tweaked further later on.
-Event files and localisation files has been consolidated a bit, to reduce number of separate files a bit and event IDs changed a bit, so it is recommended that you remove all files for previous version of this mod before updating.
-Constitutional crisis events has prestige gain/loss depending on option chosen reduced to both 15 and -15 respectively. Stability penalty/gain remain unchanged.
-The Glorious Revolution event, the precursor required to trigger the parliamentary election cycles, has legitimacy gain dropped from its effects.

------------------------------
