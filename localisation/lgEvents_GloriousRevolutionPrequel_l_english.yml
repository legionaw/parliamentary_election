 lgEventsENG_GloriousRevolutionPrequel.0001.d: "With [ROOT.Heir.GetName] being a Catholic and such, the Parliament has demanded that his Protestant daughter be married to a Protestant prince in order to preserve the preponderance of the Protestants in the line of succession to the [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] throne.

 lgEventsENG_GloriousRevolutionPrequel.0002.d: "After a fairly long reign since the Restoration, [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] has unexpectedly passed away. Having had no legitimate issue of his own, the NAME throne has passed to Catholic [ROOT.Heir.GetName], whose hereditary claim to the throne had temporarily created a controversy in the Parliament only to eventually die down. Many people were prepared to accept him as the ruler in his own right, provided, of course, that he does not undermine the Protestant church in any way and that his Protestant daughter are still the heirs to the throne. Only the time will tell whether his hold on the throne are secure or not."

 lgEventsENG_GloriousRevolutionPrequel.0003.d: "The crisis level has been truly reached in [ROOT.GetName], for the people have been increasingly alienated by [ROOT.Monarch.GetName]'s propensity to rule autocratically and by his actions continually undermining the Protestant Church. The birth of [ROOT.Monarch.GetName]'s son, which dispaced his Protestant daughter from their place on the line of succession, with its implication for a Catholic dynasty on the throne of this Protestant kingdom, has brought the crisis to its head."
 lgEventsENG_GloriousRevolutionPrequel.0003.a: "Ominious."

 lgEventsENG_GloriousRevolutionPrequel.0004.d: "The rule of [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] has not been a popular one so far. In almost every part of our country the legitimacy of his rule is being questioned as well as his devotion to the Protestant ideals our country is built on.

 lgEventsENG_GloriousRevolutionPrequel.0005.d: "Seven influential [ImmortalSevenTargetCountry.GetAdjectiveCap]men have sent us a letter urging us to come and free their kingdom from its unpopular and unable king.

 lgEventsENG_GloriousRevolutionPrequel.0006.d: "It seems the [ImmortalSevenActorCountry.GetAdjectiveCap] [ImmortalSevenActorCountry.Monarch.GetTitle] has been negotiating with the dissidents of our country. We can but lament the poor judgment of these deluded shopkeepers."
