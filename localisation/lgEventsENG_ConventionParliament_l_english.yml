 lgEventsENG_ConventionParliament.0001d: "Having been summoned by [ROOT.GloriousRevolution_GetRegentName], the Convention Parliament proceed to debate how to address the situation created by what is now known as the Glorious Revolution. A few Radicals suggested a republic in the place of the monarchy, but most Whigs were instead in favor of a limited monarchy, in which the monarch were to rule almost completely subordinated to the Parliament. To this, the Tories agreed.\nHaving settled on retention of the monarchy, albeit with its powers sharply circumscribed, the question now turned to who ought to take the throne, considering that the previous monarch had fled. The Tories, having been throughly alienated by the previous monarch but desiring continuity, suggested retention of the previous monarch, regency, or the eldest Protestant child of the previous monarch. However, the retention of the previous monarch were rejected by the Whigs. The idea of regency for the eldest son, who were raised as a Catholic, were similarly rejected. Furthermore, the suggested heir refused to rule without her husband, the Prince of Orange. Her sister also refused to rule in the place of the Prince of Orange.\nFaced with the ultimium from heir, the Tories capitulated and, with the Whigs, voted to accept her and her husband as the joint rulers, to rule jointly as the Queen and the King, respectively.\nHowever, before this can happen, the Parliament decided that it must make a declaration of the rights that have been invaded and to secure these rights forever. In the next fifteen days to follow, the Parliament now debates what will eventually become known as the Bill of Rights."

 lgEventsENG_ConventionParliament.0003d: "Having seen the dangers of not accommodating to any degree the non-conformist Protestants who were perceived as having been favored along with the Catholics by the previous regime who would have otherwise combined as a force, the Parliament accordingly decided to pass the Toleration Act which provided for the freedom of worship for non-conformist Protestants who had pledged to the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation. They are allowed their own places of worship and their own schoolteachers, as long as they accepted the certain oaths of allegiance.\nThe Act deliberately did not extended to the Roman Catholics and Unitarians, so they still have no right to assemble and pray, but they are no longer hunted down."
